# Country API

In this project, a Django REST Framework application was set up using Django 5.0.6, focusing on creating a simple API for managing country data. We defined a Country model, migrated the database, and loaded initial data from a JSON file. Subsequently, we created serializers, views, and configured URL patterns to expose the API endpoints, allowing us to perform CRUD operations on the country data. The development server was successfully run
